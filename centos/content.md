# CentOS

CentOS Linux is a community-supported distribution derived from sources
freely provided to the public by [Red Hat](ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/enterprise/)
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). As such, CentOS Linux aims to be
functionally compatible with RHEL. The CentOS Project mainly changes
packages to remove upstream vendor branding and artwork. CentOS Linux
is no-cost and free to redistribute. Each CentOS version is maintained
for up to 10 years (by means of security updates -- the duration of the
support interval by Red Hat has varied over time with respect to Sources
released). A new CentOS version is released approximately every 2 years
and each CentOS version is periodically updated (roughly every 6 months)
to support newer hardware. This results in a secure, low-maintenance,
reliable, predictable and reproducible Linux environment.

# CentOS image documentation

The `centos:latest` tag will always be the most recent version currently
available.

CentOS offers regularly updated images for all active releases. These images
will be updated monthly or as needed for emergency fixes. These rolling
updates are tagged with the major version number only. 
For example: `docker pull centos:6` or `docker pull centos:7`

Additionally, images that correspond to install media are also offered. These
images DO NOT recieve updates as they are intended to match installation iso
contents. If you choose to use these images it is highly recommended that you
include `RUN yum -y update && yum clean all` in your Dockerfile, or otherwise
address any potential security concerns. To use these images, please specify
the minor version tag:

For example: `docker pull centos:5.11` or `docker pull centos:6.6`


# Systemd integration

Currently, systemd in CentOS 7 has been removed and replaced with a
`fakesystemd` package for dependency resolution. This is due to systemd
requiring the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability, as well as being able to read
the host's cgroups. If you wish to replace the fakesystemd package and
use systemd normally, please follow the steps below.

## Dockerfile for systemd base image

    FROM centos:7
    MAINTAINER "you" <your@email.here>
    ENV container docker
    RUN yum -y swap -- remove fakesystemd -- install systemd systemd-libs
    RUN yum -y update; yum clean all; \
    (cd /lib/systemd/system/sysinit.target.wants/; for i in *; do [ $i ==
    systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service ] || rm -f $i; done); \
    rm -f /lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/*;\
    rm -f /etc/systemd/system/*.wants/*;\
    rm -f /lib/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/*; \
    rm -f /lib/systemd/system/sockets.target.wants/*udev*; \
    rm -f /lib/systemd/system/sockets.target.wants/*initctl*; \
    rm -f /lib/systemd/system/basic.target.wants/*;\
    rm -f /lib/systemd/system/anaconda.target.wants/*;
    VOLUME [ "/sys/fs/cgroup" ]
    CMD ["/usr/sbin/init"]

This Dockerfile swaps out fakesystemd for the real package, but deletes a
number of unit files which might cause issues. From here, you are ready
to build your base image.

    docker build --rm -t local/c7-systemd .

## Example systemd enabled app container

In order to use the systemd enabled base container created above, you will
need to create your `Dockerfile` similar to the one below.

    FROM local/c7-systemd
    RUN yum -y install httpd; yum clean all; systemctl enable httpd.service
    EXPOSE 80
    CMD ["/usr/sbin/init"]

Build this image:

    docker build --rm -t local/c7-systemd-httpd

## Running a systemd enabled app container

In order to run a container with systemd, you will need to use the
`--privileged` option mentioned earlier, as well as mounting the cgroups
volumes from the host. Below is an example command which will run the
systemd enabled httpd container created earlier.

    docker run --privileged -ti -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro -p 80:80 local/c7-systemd-httpd

This container is running with systemd in a limited context, but it must
always be run as a privileged container with the cgroups filesystem mounted.
